		Meme Yourself offers you the awesome feature to make OC with your own photos. For the ugly there's also a template gallery with well known meme templates. So you should be happy.
		</p>
		<p>
		But - like most users - you're probably not happy at all and demand MOAR for your dollar. So, we will deliver! With this super secret feature hack you can get any template you wish into Meme Yourself. Just follow these instructions:
		</p>
		<p>
		1. Open mobile Safari and find the image you wish to use as a meme template.
		</p>
		<p>
		2. Put your finger on the image and hold it down for several seconds until a menu pops up. Choose "Save Image".
		</p>
		<p>
		3. Open Meme Yourself and tap on the camera icon. Choose "Camera Roll" from the menu.
		</p>
		<p>
		4. Choose "Camera Roll" again and look for your saved image. (It should be the last one.)
		</p>
		<p>
		5. Select the image, crop it, and press "Choose".
		</p>
		<p>
		6. Make a cool and original meme with that image, save it.
		</p>
		<p>
		7. In future you will be able to access this image in the "Previous Memes" menu.
